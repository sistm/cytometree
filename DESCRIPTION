Description: Given the hypothesis of a bi-modal distribution of cells for
    each marker, the algorithm constructs a binary tree, the nodes of which are
    subpopulations of cells. At each node, observed cells and markers are modeled
    by both a family of normal distributions and a family of bi-modal normal mixture
    distributions. Splitting is done according to a normalized difference of AIC
    between the two families.  Method is detailed in: Commenges, Alkhassim, Gottardo, 
    Hejblum & Thiebaut (2018) <doi: 10.1002/cyto.a.23601>.
